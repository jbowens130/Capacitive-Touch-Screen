This project uses an Adafruit 2050 TFTLCD display with a resistive touchscreen overlay. It is driven by an HXD8357D chip, which was a common display driver for mobile devices. 

This code is for initialization of the display, but it is missing any graphics capabilities. 

To use this code, download it and make sure that the right COM port is typed in the compile script.

Check the wiki for a detailed description of my successes and failures on this project.
