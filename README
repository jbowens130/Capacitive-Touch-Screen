This project uses an Adafruit 2050 TFTLCD display with a resistive touchscreen overlay. It is driven by an HXD8357D chip, which was a common display driver for mobile devices. 

This code is for initialization of the display, but it is missing any graphics capabilities. 

To use this code, download it and make sure that the right COM port is typed in the compile script.

This board has two rows of headers for wiring, to use this code it must be wired with the SPI pin headers.

Pin assignments are as follows: 

Vin - 5 volts
GND - Ground
3Vo - Jumped to the IM2 pin on the board (Can also solder the jumper on the back of the board closed.)
CLK - Arduino 13
MISO - Arduino 12
MOSI - Arduino 11
CS - Arduino 10
C/D - Arduino 9

The C/D pin is VERY important, driving the pin high tells the board to expect a command, while driving it low tells the board to expect data (Such as a pixels).
